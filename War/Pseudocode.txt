		Let Suits = Hearts, etc
			Then nest and Assign Value (Ace, 1-10, J-K)
			//need loop to assign each card value
			// then loop values
			- Then Assign Score for Value (points for each value) based own Index

Create Deck (function)
	w/ length (how many cards) = (52 card array)
  	 -  collection (array of card objects - ORDERED)

	Object for Players:
	 Player1 
		Set Name: 
		Which Cards in Possession (HAND) 
		Current # of Cards: HAND.LENGTH
	 Player2
		Set Name:

Deal Deck (function) (Each player 1/2 deck:
		Move 1 card from deck[0] to player 1, then 1 card from deck[0] to player 2
		Until User 2 has 26 cards
	
Let Round = 0
Let Playground = []

Check Player Hand length & Play a Round (Function)
	If Player 1 Hand.length = 52 “Player 1 wins!”

	Else IF
	 Player 2 Hand.length = 52 “Player 2 wins!”

		“Player 1 wins Round [ROUND#]! [CardPlayedA] beats [CardPlayedB]!”
			Playground Array is added to Player 1 Hand Array
			State Player1.hand.length & State Player2.hand.length
		- ELSE If CardPlayedB.value > CardPlayed A.value:
			“Player 2 wins Round [ROUND#]! [CardPlayedB] beats [CardPlayedA]!”
			Playground Array is added to Player 2 Hand Array
			State Player1.hand.length & State Player2.hand.length
		- ELSE 
			console.log(“Let’s go to war!”)
