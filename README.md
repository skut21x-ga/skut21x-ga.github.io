# Simon: The Game of Memory

"Simon" was an electronic game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, working for toy design firm Marvin Glass and Associates, with software programming by Lenny Cope. The device created a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence (via https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game))

Each turn, the computer will give the player a color it needs to repeat back. If the player repeats the color back correctly, the computer will then repeat the previous pattern and add >a new color to the end of it's previous sequence. The player will then need to repeat the new sequence.

This version of the game also has a 'hard mode' - that has the simon board spin 360 degrees ever 2 seconds.

How to win? There currently is no end to the game - but see if you can beat the built-in high score or your own!

This version of the game I coded almost completely from scratch aside from:
